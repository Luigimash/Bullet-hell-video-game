# Bullet-hell-video-game
A video game I developed with the Unity Game Engine, scripted in C#. It is an endless survival shooter, bullet hell style, where your goal is to shoot down enemies while avoiding their barrage of bullets. 
I do not own any of the sound effects used in this project. The song that plays is Astronomia by Vicetone & Tony Igy.
